# Supplementary Materials for "On the Largest Spectral Radius with Given Eccentric Sequence"

This repository contains supplementary materials for the paper:

**"On the Largest Spectral Radius with Given Eccentric Sequence"**  
(submitted to *arXiv*)

## Contents

- `Trandpdf.py`: Python script to generate the example trees. Core computations of spectral radius and eccentric sequences.
- `plots/`: Folder containing over many subfigures illustrating the graph transformations.
- `README.md`: This file.

## How to Run Trandpdf.py

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/shuligraph/eccentric-spectral-radius.git
    cd eccentric-spectral-radius
    ```

2. Install dependencies (recommended: Python 3.8+):
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Open Trandpdf.py in VS Code and run the script. You will be prompted to input the desired values for the order n, radius r and diameter d.
    
4. After entering the values, the program will display several possible tree structures. Select one by entering its corresponding number and pressing Enter.

This will generate the necessary figures and data in the `plots/` directory.
