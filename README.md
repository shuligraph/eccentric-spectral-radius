# Supplementary Materials for "On the Largest Spectral Radius with Given Eccentric Sequence"

This repository contains supplementary materials for the paper:

**"On the Largest Spectral Radius with Given Eccentric Sequence"**  
(submitted to *arXiv*)

## Contents

- `example_tree.py`: Python script to generate the example tree with 20 vertices.
- `plots/`: Folder containing over 100 subfigures illustrating the graph transformations.
- `eccentric_sequence_analysis.py`: Core computations of spectral radius and eccentric sequences.
- `README.md`: This file.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/eccentric-spectral-radius.git
    cd eccentric-spectral-radius
    ```

2. Install dependencies (recommended: Python 3.8+):
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Run the main example:
    ```bash
    python example_tree.py
    ```

This will generate the necessary figures and data in the `plots/` directory.
